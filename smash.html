            <h4>The Super Smash Bros. Franchise is a game that has been with me since my childhood. It'll always have a
                place in my heart. The newest installation of the franchise is Super Smash Bros. Ultimate!</h4>
            <br>
            <h4>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a 2018 crossover fighting game developed by Bandai Namco Studios and
                Sora Ltd., and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is the fifth installment in the Super
                Smash Bros. series, succeeding Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. The game follows the
                series' traditional style of gameplay: controlling one of various characters, players must use differing
                attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out of an arena. It features a wide variety of game
                modes, including a campaign for single-player and multiplayer versus modes. Ultimate includes every
                playable character from previous Super Smash Bros. games—ranging from Nintendo's mascots to characters
                from third-party franchises—and several newcomers, reaching a total of over 70.</h4>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4>Competitive Smash is something I'm deeply interested in! Below are some of my favourite competitive
                smash players!</h4>

                        <h4 class="card-text">Juan "Hungrybox" Debiedma is an American Jigglypuff main currently playing
                            for Team Liquid. His success at the highest level of competition has cemented his place as
                            one of Melee's best players and one of the Five Gods. He is currently ranked 1st on MPGR
                            2018.</h4>
                        <br>
                        <h4 class="card-text">Hailing from Gainesville, Florida, Hungrybox quickly rose to become best
                            Smasher in the State, perfecting his spacing and rest setups with Jigglypuff by practicing
                            with his crew What Are the Odds. Hungrybox is notorious for his defensive playstyle, relying
                            heavily on Jigglypuff's ability to weave through opponents in the air and set up blockades
                            with several consecutive and well placed back aerials. He compounds this playstyle with his
                            very consistent punishes once given an opening, utilizing grab combos and deadly Rest setups
                            to take stocks abruptly, and excellent DI and SDI to stretch out each of Jigglypuff's stocks
                            by escaping KO setups that lesser Jigglypuff mains may fall into. All of these factors allow
                            him to grind down most matches to his preferred slow pace, often forcing the match to be
                            very focused on spacing, and grants him dominating control over the flow of a match.

                        <h4>
                            Hungrybox is well known for his ability to "clutch", or win by what seems an impossibility,
                            in a last-game, last-stock, usually last-hit fashion. This has earned him the nickname of
                            "Clutchbox".</h4>

                            summer of Melee and has been frequently attending tournaments since then. He is famous for
                            wearing a short white scarf at tournaments. He wears it as a tribute to his mother, who gave
